# Chart Integration Instructions

## Current Status
The chart pages (Planning Chart and Trading Chart) are currently using stubbed visualizations instead of LightweightCharts to prevent JavaScript errors and allow the application to load properly.

## Next Steps for Chart Integration

### 1. Install LightweightCharts
```bash
npm install lightweight-charts
```

### 2. Update the chart pages
Replace the stubbed chart creation code in both files:
- `src/pages/PlanningChartPage.jsx`
- `src/pages/TradingChartPage.jsx`

### 3. Restore the original imports
```javascript
import { createChart } from 'lightweight-charts'
```

### 4. Replace the stubbed chart creation
The stubbed innerHTML code should be replaced with the actual LightweightCharts creation code that was commented out.

### 5. Sample working chart code
```javascript
const chart = createChart(chartContainerRef.current, {
  width: chartContainerRef.current.clientWidth,
  height: 500,
  layout: {
    background: { color: '#ffffff' },
    textColor: '#333',
  }
})

const candlestickSeries = chart.addCandlestickSeries({
  upColor: '#26a69a',
  downColor: '#ef5350',
})

candlestickSeries.setData([
  { time: '2024-01-10', open: 100, high: 105, low: 98, close: 103 },
  // ... more data
])
```

## Benefits of Current Approach
- Application loads without JavaScript errors
- All navigation and layout features work properly
- Styling and responsive design are fully functional
- Easy to integrate real charts when ready
- Clear placeholder shows where charts will appear
