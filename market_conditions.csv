#
# === EXAMPLE COMPOUND CODES ===
# PRIOR_UP|TIGHT|FADE_FROM_BOTTOM|MOM_OVERSOLD|VOL_DRYING_UP|MIDMORNING
#   -> Uptrend pullback in tight range, oversold, volume declining = HIGH PROBABILITY LONG
#
# PRIOR_DOWN|WIDE|FADE_FROM_TOP|MOM_NEUTRAL|VOL_SURGING|AFTERNOON
#   -> Downtrend, wide range, volume surging = DANGER - possible breakout, avoid fade
#
# PRIOR_FLAT|VERY_TIGHT|FADE_FROM_MID|MOM_NEUTRAL|VOL_VERY_LOW|LUNCH
#   -> Lunch hour squeeze, low vol = typical consolidation but direction uncertain
